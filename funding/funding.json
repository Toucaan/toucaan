      "description": "I'm a backend developer who is interested in modern frontend technologies. For the past two years, I've been consumed by the world of CSS, its inner workings, its long-held assumptions that no longer hold true, and the limitations of responsive web design itself.\n\n I believe that the design systems today are pinned to an outdated philosophy from the past, and we're at the precipice of a new design ideology that offers better, simpler, and more maintainable option.\n\n The latest standards and accessibility features, plus a wider support across vendors make it imperative to explore our CSS tooling ground-up. I want to be able to devote a 100% of my time on Intrinsic Web Design and Toucaan for the next twelve months.\n\nPS: Personally, I like the resilience aspect of FOSS the most and despite the rise of LLMs & GPTs, I prefer writing code with my bare hands.:-P",
