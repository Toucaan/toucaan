## Getting Started

##### Step-1
The first step is to add this repository at the root of your project, like so:

```bash
    $ git submodule add https://github.com/Toucaan/toucaan
```

That's it!

This one command above will add the Toucaan submodule to your project. Now you can start designing your app and go deep into each medium for intrinsic functionality. 

```bash
    $ git status
    On branch master
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

    Changes to be committed:
    (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   .gitmodules
        new file:   toucaan
```

> Notice the new `.gitmodules` file at the root. This file stores the mapping between your projectâ€™s URL and Toucaan. Commit it to your project.


##### Step-2
Open the `desktop.scss` file at `toucaan/app/desktop/` on your favorite editor and scroll to the bottom. Start writing your application css!

```css

/***** App specific style below. ******/

@import '../../palette/colors';

/* Samples:

@import './components/header';

@import './components/main';

@import './components/footer';

@import './components/hero';

@import './forms/login';

and so onâ€¦ ****/

```

Move on to `app/mobile/mobile.scss` next to design for the phone specifically. 

Glance through the remaining subfolders and the `.scss` files that were added to your project. These will contain all the styling code for your apps across smartwatches, mobile phones, tablets (and foldables/bendables), electric vehicles, desktops, and smart TVs.
