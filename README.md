## Getting Started

##### Set up
The first step is to add this repository at the root of your project, like so:

```bash
    $ git submodule add https://github.com/Toucaan/toucaan
```

The command above will add Toucaan to your project like a submodule. That's it. It is now ready for you to start working on implementing your app's designs with support for the intrinsic qualities of the medium.

##### Configuration
A significant part of setting up CSS for the presentation layer is like setting environment variables on the client side correctly. Once you have added Toucaan to your project, the next step is to configure it. 

Specify your app's color palette, branding, other defaults etc.

Head over to our [documentation site](https://toucaan.com/docs/configuration) to take up configuration and the next steps.
