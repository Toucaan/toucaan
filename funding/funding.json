    "description": "I'm a backend developer who is interested in modern frontend technologies. For the past two years, I've been consumed by the world of CSS, its inner workings, its long-held assumptions that no longer hold true, and the limitations of responsive web design itself.\n\nI believe that the design systems today are pinned to an outdated philosophy from the past, and we're at the precipice of a new design ideology that offers better, simpler, and more maintainable options.\n\nThe latest standards and accessibility features, plus wider support across vendors, make it imperative to explore our CSS tooling ground-up. I want to be able to devote 100% of my time to Intrinsic Web Design and Toucaan for the next twelve months.\n\nPS: Personally, I like the resilience aspect of FOSS the most, and despite the rise of LLMs & GPTs, I prefer writing code with my bare hands. :-P",
